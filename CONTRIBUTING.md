Contributing Documentation

Contributions are certainly welcome and encouraged. 

Pull requests should generally describe the changes being made or the issue being addressed. 
Pull requests should be merged into the `develop` branch so that I may make any additional tweaks or adjustments before 
merging into `master` for the future release. 

Make the pull request from your own fork of the project. 
It is recommended to base it off the `develop` branch. 
However, depending how involved you would like to be, I can consider adding you to the main project if asked.
